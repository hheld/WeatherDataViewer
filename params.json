This application also provides a REST api for data contained in the weewx sqlite database.\r\n\r\n# Prerequisites\r\nMake sure that ```weewx``` is set up and running: http://www.weewx.com/.\r\nWe assume that it is set up such that all data is stored in a sqlite database (```weewx.db```).\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\nYou need to install gulp and bower once globally like this:\r\n```npm install -g gulp bower```\r\n\r\nThen, you simply do the following:\r\n\r\n1. ```npm install```\r\n2. ```bower install```\r\n3. ```gulp```\r\n\r\nRun the application simply as \r\n```\r\nnode server.js <prefix path where weewx's sqlite database resides>\r\n```\r\nFinally, open ```http://localhost:8080/wd``` in a browser. It also runs nicely on a Raspberry Pi.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
